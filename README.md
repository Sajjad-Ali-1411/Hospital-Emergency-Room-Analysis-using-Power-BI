# Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-using-Power-BI
Healthcare analytics project using Power BI to improve Emergency Room productivity by reducing wait times, optimizing staff allocation, and enhancing patient outcomes.
# 🏥 Hospital Emergency Room Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **Emergency Room (ER) productivity** using hospital data visualized in **Power BI**.  
The goal is to identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation, and provide **actionable recommendations** to hospital management.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand patient flow (peak hours, day-of-week patterns, demographics).
- Analyze **waiting time vs treatment time** to identify bottlenecks.
- Study **bed occupancy & diagnostics turnaround** to improve efficiency.
- Identify repeat visit trends and follow-up care gaps.
- Provide stakeholders with insights to **reduce ER congestion, improve care quality, and increase productivity**.

---

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** → Dashboard & visualization  
- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** → Data extraction & transformation   
- **Excel/CSV** → Data export/import  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
1. ER visits peak between **5 PM – 11 PM** → staffing should be increased during this period.  
2. **Waiting time > treatment time**, meaning bottlenecks are at **triage/registration** not clinical care.  
3. Majority of Patients are aged 20–40 years; a notable share of children (0–10) and seniors (65+).  
4. Most patients are **discharged**, suggesting urgent-care clinics could handle many.  
5. High **repeat visits** indicate poor follow-up care and discharge communication.  
6. **Lab & imaging delays** are a major contributor to overall patient length of stay.  

---

## 📈 Recommendations
- Adopt **dynamic staffing** based on demand heatmaps (hour & day-of-week).  
- Introduce a **Fast-Track zone** for low-severity cases.  
- Implement **digital check-in & AI triage** to reduce waiting times.  
- Launch **post-discharge follow-up programs** (SMS/phone calls).  
- Strengthen **urgent-care partnerships** to divert non-critical cases.  
- Track **KPIs**: wait time, occupancy rate, repeat visits, diagnostics turnaround.
